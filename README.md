# QR-Based-E-Voting-System

In contemporary democracy, it is necessary to maintain the integrity, access, and security of
 the electoral process. Most traditional voting systems, and even some computer-controlled
 systems, face challenges such as voter authentication issues, vote repetition, fraud, and manual
 vote manipulation.
 This project proposes a secure electronic voting system based on Python, Bottle, and
 MySQL, which provides an online interface for Aadhaar QR code-based voting. The sys
tem ensures secure and seamless registration and login mechanisms through camera-based QR
 scanning and Aadhaar data verification.
 It uses a centralized database to store voter data, manage voting status, and record results.
 The system is protected against multiple votes from a single user by verifying whether the voter
 has already cast a vote, thereby enhancing security. The results page dynamically updates the
 vote count for each candidate in real-time.
 Unlike the blockchain-based system, the project uses a mild architecture that ensures the
 data integrity by backend verification and authorised database management. This reduces
 confusion and makes the system easy to user for the elections.
